# Freshican

A simple Pelican theme for freshrss.org. For instructions on how to use it, please have a look at the [freshrss.org repository](https://github.com/FreshRSS/freshrss.org).

Freshican supports additional configuration variables:

- `SITELOGO`: a URL to a logo image file
- `SITEINFOS`: HTML informations to put in the footer
- `SOFTWARE`: software name, useful to add a link to [AlternativeTo](http://alternativeto.net/)

Note there is a FreshRSS-specific section in the `./templates/_header.html` file. You can adapt this part to your own needs.
